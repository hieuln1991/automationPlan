## Milestone 1: Initial Planning (Month 1)

**Objective**: Establish the foundation for test automation, including defining goals, selecting tools, and identifying test cases for automation.

### Week 1: Stakeholder Engagement and Goal Definition
- Meet with key stakeholders to define automation goals aligned with business objectives.
- Document the scope of automation (e.g., functional, regression, smoke tests).
- Set clear success metrics (e.g., speed improvements, test coverage).

### Week 2: Tool Evaluation and Selection
- Research and evaluate potential test automation tools (e.g., Selenium, Cypress).
- Select the most suitable tool(s) based on project requirements.
- Document the tool selection rationale.

### Week 3: Test Case Analysis and Prioritization
- Review existing manual test cases and identify high-priority tests for automation.
- Classify test cases based on test type (e.g., regression, smoke).
- Prioritize test cases based on business impact and execution frequency.

### Week 4: Test Strategy Development
- Develop a high-level automation test strategy document.
- Define the scope of automation, roles, responsibilities, and reporting structure.

## Milestone 2: Framework Design and Setup (Month 2)

**Objective**: Design and implement a robust automation framework, and integrate it with the CI/CD pipeline.

### Week 5: Framework Design (Part 1)
- Design the test automation framework (e.g., modular, reusable).
- Define coding standards, naming conventions, and test structure.
- Set up version control using Git.

### Week 6: Framework Design (Part 2)
- Design reusable modules for test data management, logging, and reporting.
- Define integration approach for CI/CD pipelines.

### Week 7: Framework Implementation (Part 1)
- Set up the selected automation tool (e.g., install Selenium, configure drivers).
- Integrate with reporting tools (e.g., Allure, ExtentReports).
- Create basic test scripts for simple scenarios.

### Week 8: Framework Implementation (Part 2)
- Complete the framework setup and ensure all components are integrated.
- Implement the CI/CD pipeline for running automated tests.

## Milestone 3: Test Case Development and Automation (Month 3-4)

**Objective**: Automate the high-priority test cases and ensure the framework is scalable.

### Week 9-10: Automating High-Priority Test Cases
- Begin automating high-priority tests (e.g., regression, smoke).
- Create simple automated test scripts following the established framework.

### Week 11-12: Review and Improve Test Scripts
- Review the first set of automated test cases for quality and maintainability.
- Refactor scripts for readability and remove any hardcoded data.
- Ensure automated tests run as part of the CI/CD pipeline.

### Week 13-14: Integrate with Test Management Tools
- Integrate automated tests with test management tools (e.g., TestRail, Jira).
- Set up automated reporting and log generation after each test run.

### Week 15-16: Continue Automation and Refactoring
- Automate additional test cases based on priority.
- Refactor automated tests for efficiency and reliability.

## Milestone 4: Test Execution and Maintenance (Month 5-6)

**Objective**: Execute automated tests regularly and ensure script maintenance.

### Week 17-18: Regular Test Execution
- Set up automated tests to run regularly (e.g., nightly or on each code push).
- Monitor and troubleshoot any test failures or flaky tests.

### Week 19-20: Script Maintenance
- Maintain tests based on application changes or failures.
- Continuously update test cases to reflect new features or bug fixes.

### Week 21-22: Reporting and Metrics
- Collect and analyze test execution data (e.g., pass/fail rate, test time).
- Create dashboards for tracking automation progress and effectiveness.

### Week 23-24: Test Coverage Analysis
- Evaluate test coverage and identify any gaps in the automated test suite.
- Plan additional test case automation where coverage is lacking.

## Milestone 5: Scaling and Continuous Integration (Month 7-8)

**Objective**: Expand test coverage and improve test execution efficiency.

### Week 25-26: Expand Test Coverage
- Automate additional tests based on business priorities.
- Focus on edge cases, error handling, and negative tests.

### Week 27-28: Cross-Browser and Cross-Platform Testing
- Implement cross-browser testing (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
- Ensure tests run across different platforms (e.g., Windows, macOS).

### Week 29-30: Parallel Test Execution
- Set up parallel test execution to speed up test cycles.
- Integrate the framework with cloud-based testing services for scalability.

### Week 31-32: Cloud Integration for Scaling
- Integrate cloud testing solutions (e.g., Sauce Labs, BrowserStack) to scale test execution.

## Milestone 6: Optimization and Reporting (Month 9-10)

**Objective**: Optimize test execution speed and enhance reporting.

### Week 33-34: Test Execution Optimization
- Optimize tests for better execution speed (e.g., reduce redundant steps, use parallelism).
- Implement smart test selection to only run affected tests.

### Week 35-36: Reporting Enhancements
- Enhance reporting to include more detailed information on failures and trends.
- Implement email notifications for test execution results.

### Week 37-38: Defect Management
- Integrate defect tracking into the test automation process.
- Automatically log defects when tests fail and track defect resolution.

### Week 39-40: Regression Testing Suite
- Build and maintain a comprehensive regression test suite.
- Ensure efficient execution as part of the CI/CD pipeline.

## Milestone 7: Continuous Improvement and Scaling (Month 11-12)

**Objective**: Review, scale, and optimize the automation suite for the future.

### Week 41-42: Review and Refinement
- Conduct a review of the test automation process and identify bottlenecks.
- Refactor tests for better efficiency, scalability, and maintainability.

### Week 43-44: Scaling Test Automation
- Scale automation to cover more areas of the application.
- Implement additional testing types (e.g., performance, security).

### Week 45-46: Final Report and Review
- Prepare a final report summarizing the automation progress.
- Review success against initial goals and key performance indicators (KPIs).

### Week 47-48: Plan for Next Year
- Create a roadmap for the next 12 months based on lessons learned and new requirements.
- Continue optimizing the framework and planning future improvements.
